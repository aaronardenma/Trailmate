## Demo: 

Add a section titled Demo and in there document the key features of your demo with screenshots (target 3-5, more if necessary; do not include trivial things like logging in or registering as a user).
Update the goals list from M4: Minimal (add if missing), Standard, and Stretch.
Update the Non-trivial elements section from M4, what was finished or dropped, and explain why dropped.
M5 highlights: List any M5 highlights, i.e., what has been added, changed, or removed for this milestone; especially anything that has been dropped.
